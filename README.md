# Akash Chikane - Personal Landing Page

This is my personal landing page that automatically discovers and displays all my GitHub Pages projects.

## Features

- 🎨 Beautiful, modern UI with gradient backgrounds
- 🔄 Automatically fetches all GitHub Pages using GitHub API
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🎭 Cartoony developer avatar
- 🏷️ Displays project metadata (language, stars, forks)
- 🚀 Smart project icons based on repository names and topics

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS Grid and Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub REST API

## How It Works

The page uses the GitHub API to fetch all repositories from my account and filters those that have GitHub Pages enabled. Each project is displayed as a card with relevant information and a link to visit the live site.
